Chromium-JSON
=============

Chromium application that acts as a tool and as a plugin. As a tool it allows user to format any JSON string in a way it becomes more readable. As a plugin it does the same for any JSON response from any web service.

At first this plugin was created for personal use but later published so that anyone with similar needs could benefit from it.

If you want to contribute to the application, feel free to fork it on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/PiusLT/Chromium-JSON">https://github.com/PiusLT/Chromium-JSON</a>
